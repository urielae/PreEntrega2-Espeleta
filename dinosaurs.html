              Tyrannosaurus (meaning "tyrant lizard") is an extinct genus of
              large theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex
              meaning "king" in Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially
              T-Rex, is one of the best represented members of the genus as well
              as all theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now
              western North America, on what was then an island continent known
              as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other
              tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations
              dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous period,
              68-66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the
              tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist
              before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
            </h4>

            <h4 class="pe-4">
              Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore
              with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to
              its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus
              were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had 2
              clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3-12.4
              meters (40.4-40.7 feet) in length and stands 3.66 meters (12 feet)
              tall, though T. rex could grow to lengths of around 13.2 meters
              (43.30 feet), up to 3.96 meters (13 feet) tall at the hips, and
              according to most modern estimates 8.4 metric tons (9.3 short
              tons) to 14 metric tons (15.4 short tons) in weight. Although
              other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it
              is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated
              to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial
              animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment and the
              infamous "king of the dinosaurs", Tyrannosaurus rex was most
              likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored
              herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly
              sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily
              a scavenger.
            </h4>

            <h4 class="pe-4">
              The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a
              pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most
              paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active
              predator and a scavenger. Specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex include
              some that are nearly complete skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins
              have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The
              abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into
              many aspects of its biology, including its life history and
              biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology, and potential speed
              of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is
              also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar
              from Asia to be a 2nd Tyrannosaurus species, while others maintain
              Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North
              American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with
              Tyrannosaurus.
            </h4>

            <h4 class="pe-4">
              In March 2022, new studies revealed there are three species of
              Tyrannosaurus, due to their different femurs and teeth incisors.
              The two other species are Tyrannosaurus imperator ("tyrant lizard
              emperor") and Tyrannosaurus regina ("tyrant lizard queen").
              However, in late July of that year, this research has now been
              disproved, and only Tyrannosaurus rex currently exist. As the
              archetypal theropod, Tyrannosaurus has been one of the best-known
              dinosaurs since the early 20th century and has been featured in
              film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.

              Compsognathus is an extinct genus compsognathid theropod dinosaur
              that lived in Germany and France during the Late Jurassic period.
              This little pack hunter probably ate bugs and small lizards. In
              fact, the first fossil skeleton of this dinosaur had the remains
              of its last meal, a lizard, still in its stomach.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="pe-4">
              Compsognathus is one of those dinosaurs around which some
              controversy swirls. Some paleontologists feel that, like the much
              larger Tyrannosaurus, the little Compsognathus had only two
              fingers. Others feel strongly that it had three. Since there are
              only two known fossils, and the bones are not perfectly preserved
              in an articulated (as they were in life) manner, it may take more
              discoveries to solve this issue.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="pe-4">
              Compsognathus is considered an important link in the study of bird
              evolution. The original fossil of this dinosaur was found in the
              same place as Archaeopteryx, the early feathered reptile.
              Compsognathus shares a number of characteristics with this
              creature, and close relatives of Compsognathus like
              Sinosauropteryx that had their skin preserved show the group had
              downy feathers in reality. This is one of those interesting
              dinosaurs where scientists hope to find more specimens to learn
              the answers to many questions.

              bony plates of armor on its body, even including armored eyelids.
              Its tail also had a second function; it could act as a deadly
              club. The club was used to swing around and smash into an
              attacking dinosaur. Its club was so daunting that not even a
              Tyrannosaurus rex would want to mess with this alarming species.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="pe-4">
              As a defensive creature, Ankylosaurus was one of nature's most
              perfect designs. It was almost impervious to being bitten from
              above and its long, strong tail muscles would have been able to
              swing its club with great force, however, the tail wasn't too
              flexible and could only swing 45 degrees in each direction.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="pe-4">
              There is very little fossil material from this dinosaur - it was
              apparently the last and largest of the family of armored
              dinosaurs. It walked fairly upright on all four legs, carrying its
              tail off the ground and it is theorized that it would drop to the
              ground when attacked to use its armor as a shield to cover its
              legs and underbelly.

              Brachiosaurus is a member of the sauropod family and one of the most well-known of all dinosaurs. It gets its name from the great height of its humerus, or upper arm bone - which is longer than most humans are tall. For almost a century, Brachiosaurus was considered the tallest of all dinosaurs, being over 20 metres tall. Since then, other dinosaurs have been discovered to have been taller.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="pe-4">
              Originally discovered in 1900 in Colorado, Brachiosaurus was named in 1903 by Elmer Riggs of the Field Museum in Chicago. Brachiosaurus was once thought to have lived in both the United States and Africa (Tanzania) and Europe (Portugal) in the Jurassic. Scientists believed that Africa and North America were connected during the Jurassic. However, the African species of Brachiosaurus is now thought to be a different genus called Giraffatitan.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="pe-4">
              New studies by computer specialists suggest that Brachiosaurus may not have carried its neck angle up as high as was thought once. It may have carried the neck more at a 45 - 60 degree angle.

            Ceratosaurus was a medium sized carnivore that lived at the same time as the larger Allosaurus, in the Late Jurassic period. However, it also lived some millions of years before the emergence of the successful allosauroids, being of the more primitive four fingered Ceratosauria. What makes it different and distinctive is the large horn on top of its nose and the two horns over its eyes. The use of it has been debated and is most likely used for display (it can be hypothesized that keratinor soft tissue covered the horns), a weapon, or a special used for courtship battles. About 100 years ago, when it was first discovered, it was one of the most well-known dinosaurs. Other unusual features is that Ceratosaurus had a row of osteoderms running along its spine to the tail and four fingers on its hands, instead of the more common three among the other large meat-eaters during its time. This is typically an indication that this theropod is relatively primitive, whose ancestral relatives are from the earlier times of the Mid Triassic to Mid Jurassic periods when coelophysoideans and ceratosaurians were much more prevalent. Allosaurids and megalosaurian carnosaurs, both kinds tetanurans, were much more advanced, with greater speed and intelligence, as well as the ability in at least allosaurids to form packs.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            It is probable that the Ceratosaurus ended up being sidelined by the Allosaurus in North America, as evidenced by the fact that Ceratosaurus is the rarest fossil theropod genus present in the magnificent Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry. It probably became a prowler of the forest, using its terrifying dentition when ambushing smaller dinosaurs.

            Corythosaurus is an extinct genus of hadrosaur dinosaur that lived in the Late Cretaceous period. Its name means "Helmet lizard".
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Corythosaurus had hundreds of small interlocking teeth at the back of its jaw, allowing it to crush and grind plant matter. The bony crest on top of its head contained its nasal passage and may have been used as a sounding device.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">Like other duckbills and some other late Cretaceous plant-eating dinosaurs, Corythosaurus had huge numbers of teeth crammed together into "batteries" forming a single grinding surface on each side of the upper and lower jaws. This allowed the dinosaur to process large amounts of food at once. The hadrosaurines had broad, "ducklike" snouts to cut a wide swathe through the herb layer, while lambeosaurines such as Corythosaurus had narrower snouts and presumably fed more selectively.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            The most distinctive feature of the lambeosaurines was the hollow bony crest on top of the head. The size and shape of these crests varied greatly. As a result, different skeletons of Corythosaurus have been identified as belonging to at least seven different species. However, comparison of more than 20 skulls has shown that the crest changes as it grows and differs between the sexes. Only a single species is, therefore, now recognized. The large-crested individuals are thought to be the adult males. They probably used the crest to intimidate others males. The skin covering the crest may have been brightly coloured or patterned, and the hollow within the bone, which was connected to the airway, may have been used to produce distinctive honking calls.

These were probably used as a display for courtship purposes. (Its frill and ability to spit venom at its prey is actually made up and no there is no proof if it had such abilities) Dilophosaurus has been found in Northern Arizona.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            As a more primitive predatory dinosaur, Dilophosaurus didn't have forward facing eyes to give it stereo vision. It may have used scent as an integral part of its hunting technique. It had long and slender, rear-curving teeth in long jaws and strong front arms which would have been effective in grabbing prey. It was fast - probably with a top speed of about 30-mph. Footprints attributed to Dilophosaurus appear in groups, so it may have hunted in small packs. It shares the same overall body configuration as Coelophysis even though Dilophosaurus is currently classified as a member of a different group of theropods rather than Coelophysis and its relatives.

          <h4 class="pe-4">
            This was only the second dinosaur to be described, after Megalosaurus. Its teeth were discovered in the early 1820s in England - these original fossils were "rediscovered" in the British Museum in 1977. As nothing like it had ever been described in scientific literature, the teeth of this creature were a puzzle that an amateur paleontologist named Gideon Mantell solved by comparing them to the teeth of living animals. Mantell found that the teeth looked like those of a modern iguana and named it Iguanodon. He speculated that it was a huge extinct version of this modern reptile. It was in 1878 in a coal mine in Belgium that 24 fairly complete and articulated specimens were found. Although they were of a larger species, they clearly showed what this creature looked like in life.

            Mamenchisaurus is one of the most unique long-necked dinosaurs for a very good reason - it has a really long neck. In fact, it had the longest neck of any creature that ever lived. Stretching 18 metres (60 feet), the neck on Mamenchisaurus was longer than a school bus. The rest of it was just like other members of its family; a long tail, with stout legs.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Mamenchisaurus had 19 neck vertebrae, more than any other dinosaur. The vertebrae had long struts running between them that would have limited the ability of Mamenchisaurus to turn its neck too sharply, but it could still reach well up into the trees to feed. This plant-eater had spatula-shaped teeth that seem to have been well designed to chew coarse plant material. This is one feature that makes it different from the members of the Diplodocidae family, which had peg shaped teeth, to which it has been thought to belong. It is now being thought of as possibly part of a group of sauropods unique to Asia. Most of the big Asian sauropods, such as Omeisaurus, had spatulate teeth. In fact, the Asian sauropods, including Mamenchisaurus, seem to share more characteristics with Brachiosaurus than with Diplodocus. For evidence of this, one needs to look no further than the nose - Mamenchisaurus and other Asian sauropods are very close in evolutionary terms to that of Brachiosaurus. It is also thought that another aspect that these creatures had in common was that they were finding their food high off the ground. Diplodocus and Apatosaurus on the other hand were likely feeding on low growing plants

            Ouranosaurus (meaning "brave lizard") was a hadrosauriform dinosaur that lived in Africa during the Early Cretaceous period. Ouranosaurus had a hump similar to that of present day camels. Ouranosaurus lived in Africa during the Cretaceous period, alongside predators like Suchomimus, Eocarcharia, and Sarcosuchus, and was their common prey.

            Pachycephalosaurus is the last, largest, and most famous member of the pachycephalosaurs, or thick-headed “bone headed” dinosaurs. In the 1970s, paleontologist Peter Galton proposed that male pachycephalosaurs used their dome heads as battering rams, like bighorn sheep. 
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            But by the 1990s, scientists began to question Galton's head butting theory. It was pointed out that animals who do butt heads have a wide surface area where the heads come into contact to prevent "head slippage." This happens when two animals butt heads at high speed and do not hit straight on. The risk of breaking their necks when their heads suddenly snap to one side. Pachycephalosaurus has a domed, or rounded, head, which would minimize surface contact and therefore increase the risk of head slippage. This throws doubt on the idea of any high speed head-butting between pachycephalosaurs, but it does not exclude "head-pushing" of "head-ramming" against non-pachycephalosaurs.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Recent evidence suggests that Pachycephalosaurus and possibly other pachycephalosaur species were more omnivorous than previously thought, consisting of both plants and meat due to the teeth they have in their mouths.

            Parasaurolophus is an extinct genus of hadrosaurid (sometimes referred to as the hadrosaurs or duck-billed dinosaurs) from approximately 76.5–73 million years ago (late Cretaceous). It is a herd animal feeding on the park’s rich vegetation. The most stunning feature of the Parasaurolophus is the crest on its head. Scientists were unsure of its function until today. Some believed it was a snorkel for when the animal was in the water, others felt that it was used in combat. We now know that it serves for display and for communication, allowing the animals to remain in contact over distance by amplifying their loud cries.

            Pteranodon is a large flying reptile with a wingspan measuring as long as a school bus. These reptiles did not have feathers but rather had a basal type of integument along the same lineage from which feathers evolved, called pycnofibers. Pycnofibers were very hair-like in appearance and, like hair, were made of keratin.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Members of the Pterosaur order lived through much of the Mesozoic, some species of Pterosaurs with wingspans close to 11 meters (36 feet). Pteranodon males had a wingspan of 5 meters (16 feet), while females had a wingspan of 3 meters (10 feet), making the males one of the largest Pterosaurs found.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Pteranodon means "toothless wing," but despite this, it appears with teeth in one of the movies. It probably used the long crest on the back of its head to help it steer while flying.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Their diet was comprised of fish and scavenged remains of dead marine animals. Quite a few Pteranodon skeletons have been found in Kansas in the central part of the U.S. This would have been the shore of a shallow sea when these creatures were alive, supporting the theory that they were fish eaters.

            Spinosaurus (meaning "spined lizard") is an extinct genus of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur that existed in what is now North Africa during the Cretaceous period. Spinosaurus is argued to be the longest of all known carnivorous dinosaurs, even longer than Carcharodontosaurus, Giganotosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus rex. It is also the largest species of spinosaurid, with the largest specimen, MSMN V4047 reaching 14 meters (46 feet) in length, although classification of MSMN V4047 remains highly debated in the scientific community. Its smaller relatives include Suchomimus, Baryonyx, Irritator, Ichthyovenator, and a newly discovered species called Iberospinus. 
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Its most distinctive feature was the huge sail on its back. This sail was comprised of spines that extended from the top of the backbones of all dinosaurs and vertebrates. The spines of Spinosaurus were tremendous, the longest one found measured over 1.7 meters (5 feet) tall. The sail might have been used to attract a mate, making it look bigger to other predators it shares with, or speculatively act as a dorsal fin as it moves through the water.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Similar to its relatives within the spinosauridae, it had large, powerful arms and enormous, hook like claws for grabbing prey, much like modern bears do today.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Discovered by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1912, the first Spinosaurus fossils were kept in the building that housed the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology. Unfortunately, on April 24/25 in 1944, the fossils, along with the original specimen of Carcharodontosaurus and most of Stromer's other collection of fossils, were destroyed during a British bombing raid in World War II, when Allied Forces attacked Berlin, Germany. The museum was an unfortunate casualty of the raid, as it was right across the street from the Nazi Party's headquarters (the intended target), and the museum's curator had refused to move the fossils to a safer location. New fossils of both dinosaurs would not be uncovered again until roughly 100 years later, though drawings and photos of the Spinosaurus specimens recovered by Stromer remained intact.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            In 2014 and 2019, the nature of Spinosaurus was rendered even stranger when it was discovered by paleontologists Nizar Ibrahim and Paul Sereno to have possessed short hind legs, webbed feet, and a long, paddle-like tail similar to a newt or crocodile's and that the sail was probably more rectangular. These new discoveries suggested that Spinosaurus was better adapted to life in water than previously assumed, rendering its physical appearance in the Jurassic Park franchise outdated. Studies of the sub-adult specimen Sereno and Ibrahim recovered from their 2014 and 2019 expeditions to Morocco further suggested Spinosaurus preferred to hunt in shallow water. There is also some evidence that Oxalaia, a spinosaur from Brazil, is the same animal as Spinosaurus. If true, this suggests Spinosaurus was present in Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period.

            Stegosaurus is easily one of the best known dinosaurs and is recognized all over the world. It is the largest and most famous member of the stegosaur family. It roamed the open plains of the Late Jurassic Period in what is now North America. The plates along its back, its small head and spiked tail make it a peculiar and unique dinosaur. This plant-eater evolved to find its food in the low-growing plants of the late Jurassic. The spikes on its tail would have made a powerful weapon against any hungry predators.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Stegosaurus is often called the dumbest dinosaur because of its incredibly small brain. In fact, most scientists originally believed that its brain was too small to control such a large creature and that it used an auxiliary "brain" located above its rear legs to help control its movements. This was not actually a brain, but a bundle of nerves that helped relay information from its real brain. Its brain was once thought to have been the size of a walnut, but CAT-scans proved that it was actually the size of a kitten.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Most fascinating to people are the plates along its back. There has been a great deal of debate about their use and arrangement. The plates were up to 2-feet tall and 2-feet wide (0.6 meters). The most prevalent theory is that they were used for cooling or heating the animal. A more recent theory, however, suggests that they could have been used as a display during courtship and that they may have been brightly colored. It is also possible that they could move up and down, perhaps to intimidate predators.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            The spikes on its tail are also the subjects of some controversy. For years, every model of Stegosaurus showed it with the spikes sticking up into the air. It is only since the 1990s that it has become accepted that these spikes stuck out horizontal to the ground, which would have been a potent defensive weapon when swung at a hunter.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Stegosaurus would have lived in family groups and herds, moving slowly through forests while eating the low-growing plants. Its front legs were considerably shorter than it's hind legs, making it adapted to nibbling the plants closest to the ground. Stegosaurus is the namesake for a large family of dinosaurs whose members were found all over the world. The Stegosaurus (its code name "Stego") was a peaceful herbivore and probably roamed the prehistoric highlands in herds that size from small to large numbers, grazing on low ground plants. An average Stegosaurus was about the size of an elephant, standing about 11 feet tall. It had a very low intelligence (its brain was the size of a kitten). The bony plates on it's back may have served a dual purpose of a body temperature regulation and protection from large flesh-eating predators. Different species varied in the number of plates on their back.

            Triceratops is an extinct genus of herbivorous chasmosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur which lived at the very end of the Cretaceous period. It had a huge frilled head with horns over each eye that could reach over 3 feet long. Triceratops had a third, smaller horn on its nose. These would be fearsome weapons against a predator.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Triceratops is one of the most common dinosaur fossils found. More than 50 skulls have been found. Within the genus, at least 7 species have been identified. The ceratopsian family is one of the most successful and varied of the Late Cretaceous. Triceratops is the largest member of this family, reaching the size of a school bus.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            Triceratops was a herd animal; it is believed that large groups numbering into the hundreds roamed North America. Their large, horny beaks and long rows of teeth were well designed for chewing the tough, low-growing plants of the Late Cretaceous. It was likely the main predator of these animals was Tyrannosaurus rex. A number of skeletons show bite and chew marks that match the teeth of T. rex. Horns and frills seemed to vary among individuals within the species. Some frills were very broad, others narrow. The nasal horn shows the most variance among individual specimens, no two being the same. The material that covered its horns in life would have added significantly to the length of the fossilized bone.
          </h4>
          <h4 class="pe-4">
            In 2009, researchers under supervision of Jack Horner argued that Triceratops was actually a juvenile version of Torosaurus. The massive frill of Triceratops would grow longer and thinner in time, until it may have had the same holes as seen in Torosaurus. However, this evidence is still open to criticism and is still yet to be fully accepted by the scientific community.

            The Velociraptor is 3 to 5 meter long, 1.7 meter tall dromaeosaurid theropod carnivore. 
            Velociraptors are highly intelligent pack hunters. They could run 40-60 mph (65-100 km/h) at full sprint - fast enough to outrun many other dinosaurs. They have a primitive level of vocalization which enables them to direct attacks and call for help. They are also capable of setting traps for their prey.
